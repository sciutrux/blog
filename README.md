4.2.2020  
GitHub Pages should by default use Minima theme: https://github.com/jekyll/minima.  
Added _ config.yml from minima, seems now to behave like Minima theme was selected as theme.  
  
6.2.2020  
Added _ posts folder, started to display "Posts" with one test post added.  
Social links are not shown? RSS came up when _ posts was added.
